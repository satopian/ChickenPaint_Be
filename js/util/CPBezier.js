    // How to use this class:
    //
    // 1 - set the 4 points coordinates (x0-3, y0-3)
    // two options:
    // 2a - call init() with desired dt then read the current coordinate (Bx, By) and use nextPoint() to compute the
    // next point
    // 2b - use one of the "compute" methods to compute the values for the whole curve in one step

    // The 4 points coordinates
